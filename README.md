# FullStack-Task-Manager Project

## Introduction

The FullStack-Task-Manager project aims to evolve into an industry-ready web application that facilitates comprehensive task management and collaboration for full-stack application development. This document outlines our development roadmap and presents the planned architecture to guide our team through the phases of development, ensuring alignment and clarity on our goals and strategies.

## Project Architecture

Below is the architecture diagram of the FullStack-Task-Manager, detailing the interactions between its components:

## Architecture Overview
This document provides an overview of the architecture of our web application, outlining its key components and their interactions.

### Frontend
The frontend of our application is responsible for presenting the user interface and handling user interactions. It consists of a React Application, utilizing WebSocket for real-time communication, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Backend
Our backend serves as the core logic and data access layer of the application. It comprises a Node.js Server hosting a RESTful API and an Authentication & Authorization system to ensure secure access. This component facilitates communication between the frontend and the database.

### Database
The database component manages data storage and retrieval. It is managed by Prisma ORM and utilizes either PostgreSQL or MySQL as the relational database system. Prisma ORM abstracts database operations, simplifying data management for the backend.

### Collaboration and Version Control
This component facilitates team collaboration and version control for development workflows. We integrate with Git for version control, enabling efficient tracking of code changes, and leverage file sharing capabilities (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for collaborative document editing.

### Deployment and Monitoring
Deployment and monitoring ensure efficient deployment and continuous monitoring of the application's performance. Docker and Kubernetes are utilized for containerization and orchestration, respectively. Additionally, we employ CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated deployment and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) for performance assessment and issue resolution.

### External Services
External services enhance the functionality of the application by providing additional capabilities. Cloud storage integration supports file storage needs, while notification services keep users informed about important updates or events.

### Overall System Interactions
Frontend-Backend Interaction: The frontend interacts with the backend to serve user requests and display data.
Backend-Database Interaction: The backend communicates with the database for data storage and retrieval.
Backend-Collaboration & Version Control Interaction: The backend integrates with collaboration and version control tools for development workflows.
Backend-Deployment & Monitoring Interaction: Deployment and monitoring services support the backend for operational efficiency.
External Services Interaction: External services enhance both frontend and backend with additional capabilities.
This architecture represents a comprehensive approach to building a scalable, collaborative, and efficient web application, incorporating modern development practices and tools.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening

- **Technical Stack Evaluation**: Review and optimize the use of React, Node.js, and Prisma ORM.

### Phase 2: Collaboration Tools Integration

- **Real-time Communication**: Implement chat functionality for immediate team interaction.
- **File Sharing Capability**: Enable document sharing relevant to tasks and projects.

### Phase 3: Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment Strategy**: Utilize Docker and Kubernetes for efficient deployment.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and Sentry for comprehensive monitoring.

### Phase 4: Beta Testing and Feedback

- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### Phase 5: Final Adjustments and Launch

- **Optimization and Polishing**: Refine features and performance based on feedback.
- **Launch Preparation**: Finalize marketing and support plans for the launch.

## Conclusion

Our commitment to developing the FullStack-Task-Manager into a leading tool for development teams is unwavering. This roadmap and architecture plan lay the groundwork for a scalable, efficient, and collaborative application that meets the complex needs of full-stack projects.
